## Getting Started

  Please make sure that you have:

-  [Node.js](http://www.dropwizard.io/1.0.2/docs/) istalled. Since _npm_ has been used for managing dependencies, this is the recommended go-to package manager.

-  [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli#installation) installed globally:

`npm install -g @angular/cli`

- all the dependecies needed:

run `npm install` int the project folder
 
To run a dev server use `ng serve` command and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/` in your browser - any local changes will be automatically updated.
